# NumberOneFan

On Jamendo I follow different artists. Unfortunately there is no way to get automatically informed when one of those artists releases a new Album/Track.

This script fetches all/in a given timeframe albums/tracks using the Jamendo Api.

### Usage
+ Create an account at the devportal if you haven't already.
+ Create an application there to get a client Id.
+ Use this client Id for my $client_id = "yourID";

my $artist_id = "yourJamendoName";

for a specific timeframe use:  
my $datefrom = "2017-05-01";  
my $dateto = "2017-12-31";

This project is in no way affiliated with Jamendo.
